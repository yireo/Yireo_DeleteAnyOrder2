# Why is this extension rather cheap?
We have spent years on optimizing our Magento 1 extension and were able
to successfully move the logic to M2 as well. Also, we are part of
ExtDN, various Magento working groups and expert-trainers in the field
of Magento 2 development. In short, we know our stuff and are able to
put down a cheap but high quality extension for you.
